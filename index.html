			In this new installment of the Mario Kart series, Coins make a prominent return. Coins have not been featured in this way in the last 
			Mario Kart games since Mario Kart: Super Circuit. Coins are to be found along a race track, and can be underwater, on the road, or in 
			the air. Collecting coins on different tracks will allow the player to unlock vehicle parts used for customization. The option to 
			select classic Mario Kart tracks is also available again in this game. Mario Kart 7 also has some new features. Players can now use 
			air gliders, which can be useful for navigating through the air and also use propellers to drive underwater. In addition, players 
			may now assemble their own karts, rather than select pre-set karts as in older Mario Kart games. It is possible to select the body 
			of the kart, the wheels, and other additional accessories such as the glider, although some parts need to be unlocked before they 
			can be used. When the player is selecting a character and changing things to their kart the selection theme is played. Mario Kart 7 
			marks the return of the traditional 8 characters per race, as opposed to the total of 12 as seen in the previous installment. 
			It is also compatible with both SpotPass and StreetPass.
		</p>
		<p>
			Among other gameplay's innovations is the vehicle's behavior in the courses. Each element to assemble the vehicle have a function that 
			grant advantage on certain courses: for example, the type of wheel selected may work well in concrete road, soil or rough terrain that 
			a course may have. Gliders also provide speed and duration for the vehicle when airborne and can be controlled using only the . 
			Additionally, driving underwater, the kart's handling, speed and drifting can considerably change compared to when driving on land. 
			Mario Kart 7 also introduces the option to race in a first-person view, where the player will watch the race from the character's own 
			eyes, instead of the usual overview of the track from his/her back in the other six installments. In this view, the player can also see 
			the vehicle's steering wheel in front of the character. In a minor note, a small additional beat of the track's music plays if the player 
			gets ahead in first place. The small beat fades when the player slows down the kart via braking, going off-road, or getting hit by an 
			item. This only happens when the player is playing on 100cc, 150cc or Mirror.
		</p>
		<p>
			Motorbikes, which made their first appearance in Mario Kart Wii, do not return in the game. However, Tricks, which were also introduced 
			in Mario Kart Wii, come back to be part of Mario Kart 7's gameplay and can be used with Gliders for more speed. Mission Mode and the 
			Single Player version of VS mode are also absent from this game.
